# Symfony Task Manager

**Symfony Task Manager** is a backend API for managing tasks, subtasks, tags, and task lists.  
Users can create, manage, and organize their tasks to efficiently plan their days.

This project was built as a solo effort to learn Symfony from scratch, and to challenge myself to design a complete, tested, and secure API.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Running the Project Locally

A few steps are required to be able to run the project, this includes setting up the database, running migrations, and starting the webserver:

1. Start the database container:
```
docker compose up -d
```
2. Install the required PHP packages:
```
composer install
```
3. Run the database migrations:
```
php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
```
4. Start the Symfony local server:
```
symfony serve
```

## üß™ Testing
* The project contains 76 tests and 223 assertions.
* Tests are run against a dedicated PostgreSQL test database ‚Äî no mocking is used.
* GitHub Actions automatically runs the full test suite on every push or pull request to the main branch.

To run tests locally:
```
php bin/phpunit
```

## üìñ API Documentation
* Full API documentation is available using NelmioApiDocBundle (OpenAPI 3).
* After running the server, access the documentation at:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/doc
```
